= Text markup

This page details any specific ways in which Metanorma interprets Asciidoctor markup,
as well as custom markup directives supported across most of the
link:/flavours/[officially supported Metanorma flavours].


== Unsupported Asciidoctor features

Sidebars (`aside`) are not supported, and have been repurposed for link:./#reviewer-notes[reviewer comments].
Page breaks (`thematic break`) are not supported; ASCII art/preformatted text (`literal`)
are not supported in most Metanorma flavours.


== Autonumbering

Autonumbering in Metanorma extends to formulas (which are encoded as "stem" blocks) and notes.
Autonumbering is applied in the conversion from Metanorma XML to output formats (`isodoc`);
by default it restarts for each annex, but is continuous for the main body of text.


== Document sections

Sections are marked off in Asciidoc with titles prefixed by double equal signs, `==`.

=== Fixed section names

Metanorma relies on certain pre-defined section titles
to identify the different kinds of sections in the document, namely these:

- `Abstract`
- `Introduction`
- `Scope`
- `Normative References`
- `Terms and Definitions`
- `Symbols and Abbreviations`
- `Bibliography`

As an alternative
(if the document deviates from that naming structure, or is in a language other than English),
the section can be prefixed with a `heading=` attribute
that provides the English canonical form of the section name. For example:

[source,asciidoc]
--
== Normative References

[heading=terms and definitions]
== Terms, definitions and abbreviations
--

=== Obligations

The obligation of a section—whether it is normative or informative—is indicated
with the attribute "obligation".

For most sections, this is fixed; for annexes and clauses,
the default value of the obligation is "normative" and users need to set the obligation
to "informative" as a section attribute if needed. For example:

[source,asciidoctor]
--
[[AnnexA]]
[appendix,obligation=informative]
== Determination of defects
--

=== The Foreword

The Foreword of a standard is detected as any text between the document header
and the first section header.

In the example below, AsciiISO Rice document specifies the `.Foreword` title
to the foreword in the source, but Metanorma will supply the "Foreword" title
regardless of what title is given.

----
[[foreword]]
.Foreword
The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium ("`CalConnect`") is global non-profit
organization with the aim to facilitate interoperability of technologies across
user-centric systems and applications...
----

=== The “Terms and Definitions” section

==== Grammar

Terms and Definitions sections follow a strict grammar, which is reflected in their AsciiDoc markup:

* The term is given as a subheading at the appropriate level (three equal signs, unless there are subsections in the Terms and Definition section). The term may be crossreferenced from other terms, in which case it should have an anchor.
* The term is optionally followed by alternative/admitted terms, which must be marked up in an `+alt:[...]+` macro; deprecated terms, which must be marked up in a `+deprecated:[...]+` macro; and a term domain, which must be marked up in a `+domain:[...]+` macro.
* The definition of the term is given in a separate paragraph.
* The definition is optionally followed by examples (paragraphs with an `[example]` style attribute).
* The definition is then optionally followed by notes (denoted with a `NOTE:` prefix).
* The definition is then followed by a citation for the term, marked with a `[.source]` role attribute). 
* The citation is a cross-reference to a normative reference, optionally followed by a comma and a modification if applicable.

For example,

[source,asciidoc]
--
[[paddy]]
=== paddy 
alt:[paddy rice]
alt:[rough rice]
deprecated:[cargo rice]
domain:[rice]

rice retaining its husk after threshing

[example]
Foreign seeds, husks, bran, sand, dust.

NOTE: The starch of waxy rice consists almost entirely of amylopectin. The kernels have a tendency to stick together after cooking. 

[.source]
<<ISO7301,section 3.2>>, The term "cargo rice" is shown as deprecated,
and Note 1 to entry is not included here
--

The requirement that the source of a term be given in a citation also applies when the source is a term bank, such as the http://www.electropedia.org[International Electrotechnical Vocabulary (IEV)]. Formally, IEV references should be cited as `IEC 60050-nnn:20xx`, where `n` is the top-level clause, and `20xx` is the year when that particular specification was published; e.g. `IEC 60050-113:2011, 113-01-07`. For convenience, this gem requires all IEV references to be to a single reference, named `IEV` in the normative references. In rendering the Asciidoctor into Metanorma XML, this reference will be replaced by the various required IEC 60050-nnn:20xx references. (That means that you should not insert your own instances of IEC 60050 references for IEV citations: they will be duplicated by the automatically generated references.)

[source,asciidoc]
--
[.source]
<<ievtermbank,clause="103-01-02">>

...

[bibliography]
* [[[ievtermbank,IEV]]], _IEV: Electropedia_
// will be excluded from HTML and Word output. Will be replaced by a canonical reference in XML output.
--

Note that, for IEV entries to be validated, the IEV reference must be given as a Clause, and in quotes (otherwise the locality syntax would be interpreted as a range); so `<<ievtermbank,clause="103-01-02">>` for IEV 103-01-02.

Asciidoctor does not permit macros to be nested inside other macros; so the following markup, introducing a stem expression as an admitted term, is illegal. (The use of stem expressions as preferred terms is not a problem, because the macro appears as a header.)

[source,asciidoc]
--
=== stem:[t_90] 
alt:[stem:[t_A]]

Time to launch.
--

However, the gem will treat any standalone paragraph in a term section, consisting of just a stem macro, as an admitted term:

[source,asciidoc]
--
=== stem:[t_90] 

stem:[t_A]

Time to launch.
--

As defined above, all terminal subclauses of a term section are treated as term definitions. Exceptionally, an introductory section can be treated as a subclause instead of a term, by prefixing it with the style attribute `[.nonterm]`:

[source,asciidoctor]
--
== Terms and definitions

[.nonterm]
=== Introduction
The following terms have non-normative effect, and should be ignored by the ametrical.

=== Anapaest

metrical foot consisting of a short, a long, and a short
--

==== Title

The title of a top-level Terms and Definitions clause is populated automatically,
overriding the title provided by the user: if it contains a Symbols and Abbreviated Terms subclause,
it is titled _Terms, definitions, symbols and abbreviated terms_,
otherwise it is titled _Terms and definitions_.
A Terms and Definitions clause will be recognised if either title is given,
regardless of case.
Symbols and Abbreviated Terms subclauses are also automatically titled;
other subclauses of Terms and Definitions clauses are not.

==== Source

If the Terms and Definitions of a standard are partly or fully sourced from
another standard, that standard is cited in a `source` attribute to the section,
which is set to the reference anchor of the standard given under the Normative
References.
(The attribute needs to be applied to the top-level clause, if there are subclauses.)

Any boilerplate of the Terms and Definitions section is adjusted accordingly.

[source,asciidoctor]
--
[source=ISO712]
== Terms and Definitions
--

Multiple sources are allowed, and need to be quoted and comma-delimited:

[source,asciidoctor]
--
[source="ISO712,ISO24333"]
== Terms and Definitions
--

==== Subclauses within “Terms & Definitions”

Normally any terminal subclause in a Terms & Definitions section is treated as a term
definition. Exceptionally, an introductory section can be tagged to be treated as a clause,
instead of a term, by prefixing it with the style attribute `[.nonterm]`.

[source,asciidoctor]
--
== Terms and definitions

[.nonterm]
=== Introduction
The following terms have non-normative effect, and should be ignored by the ametrical.

=== Anapaest

metrical foot consisting of a short, a long, and a short
--

Any clause within a Terms & Definitions section which is a nonterminal subclause (has
child nodes) is automatically itself a terms (or definitions) section. On the other hand,
any descendant of a nonterm clause is also a nonterm clause.

Informative clauses are indicated with the attribute `[obligation=informative]`;
clauses are normative by default.

===== Blank subclases

Blank subclause headings can be given as `=== {blank}`.
These are used when you want to give a subclause number for a new subclause,
but without an associated header text. So e.g. in the Rice Model document,

[source,asciidoc]
--
=== Physical and chemical characteristics 

==== {blank}

The mass fraction of moisture, determined in accordance with...
--

renders as 

____
*4.2. Physical and chemical characteristics*

*4.2.1.*  The mass fraction of moisture, determined in accordance with...
____

[NOTE]
====
This notation should not be used to implement paragraph numbering as required for UNECE.
The link:/flavours/unece/[UNECE Metanorma flavour] treats each paragraph
as a distinct clause and automatically numbers it.
====

===== Inline headings

Inline subclause headings (e.g. for test methods) are indicated by preceding the heading
with the `[%inline-header]` option attribute. So in the Rice Model document,

[source,asciidoc]
--
[%inline-header]
==== Sieve, 

with round perforations of diameter 1,4 mm.
--

renders as 

____
*A.2.1.1. Sieve,* with round perforations of diameter 1,4 mm.
____

==== Symbols and Abbreviations

Symbols and Abbreviations sections are expected to be simple definition lists
(http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#labeled-list[“labelled lists”]
in Asciidoctor nomenclature).

Metanorma takes care of sorting the symbol entries in the order prescribed by ISO/IEC DIR 2,
provided the symbols are in AsciiMath; sorting MathML entries is not currently supported.

==== Empty section

If there are no terms and definitions defined in this standards document,
no terms should be included in the section body (it should be blank).
The boilerplate at the start of the section is adjusted to reflect both possibilities;
any paragraphs or lists in the Asciidoctor input (which can replicate the expected boilerplate)
is stripped in the intermediate XML format.

=== Sections embedded more than 5 levels

Asciidoctor permits only 5 levels of section embedding (not counting the document title).
Standards do contain more levels of embedding; ISO/IEC DIR 2 only considers it a problem
if there are more than 7 levels of embedding. To realise higher levels of embedding,
prefix a 5-level section title with the attribute `level=`:

[source,asciidoctor]
--
====== Clause 5

[level=6]
===== Clause 6

[level=7]
====== Clause 7A

[level=7]
====== Clause 7B

[level=6]
====== Clause 6B

====== Clause 5B
--

This generates the following ISO XML:

[source,xml]
--
<clause id="_" inline-header="false" obligation="normative">
	<title>
		Clause 5 
	</title>
	<clause id="_" inline-header="false" obligation="normative">
		<title>
			Clause 6 
		</title>
		<clause id="_" inline-header="false" obligation="normative">
			<title>
				Clause 7A 
			</title>
		</clause>
		<clause id="_" inline-header="false" obligation="normative">
			<title>
				Clause 7B 
			</title>
		</clause>
	</clause>
	<clause id="_" inline-header="false" obligation="normative">
		<title>
			Clause 6B 
		</title>
	</clause>
</clause>
<clause id="_" inline-header="false" obligation="normative">
	<title>
		Clause 5B 
	</title>
</clause>
--


== Paragraphs

Paragraph alignment is defined as an attribute for paragraphs:

[source,asciidoctor]
--
[align=left]
This paragraph is aligned left

[align=right]
This paragraph is aligned right

[align=center]
This paragraph is aligned center

[align=justified]
This paragraph is justified, which is the default
--

== Block quotes

As in normal Asciidoctor, block quotes are preceded with an author and a citation;
but the citation is expected to be in the same format as all other citations, 
a cross-reference optionally followed by text, which may include the bibliographic
sections referenced:

[source,asciidoctor]
--
[quote, ISO, "ISO7301,section 1"]
_____
This International Standard gives the minimum specifications for rice (_Oryza sativa_ L.) 
which is subject to international trade. It is applicable to the following types: husked rice 
and milled rice, parboiled or not, intended for direct human consumption. It is neither 
applicable to other products derived from rice, nor to waxy rice (glutinous rice).
_____
--


== Strikethrough and small caps

The following formatting macros are used for strikethrough and small caps text:

[source,asciidoctor]
--
[strike]#strike through text#
[smallcap]#small caps text#
--


== Terms

To ensure the structure of Terms and Definitions is captured accurately, the following
macros are defined, and must be used to mark up their respective content:

`alt:[TERM]`:: for alternative terms
`deprecated:[TERM]`:: for deprecated terms
`domain:[TERM]`:: for term domains

The macro contents can contain their own markup.

[source,asciidoctor]
--
=== paddy 
alt:[_paddy_ rice]
deprecated:[#[smallcap]#cargo# rice]
domain:[rice]

_paddy_ (<<paddy>>) from which the husk only has been removed
--


== Lists

Ordered lists in both HTML and Word have their labels pre-configured
to align with ISO/IEC DIR 2:

- _a), b), c)_ for the first level,
- then _1), 2), 3)_ for the second level,
- then _i), ii), iii)_,
- then _A), B), C)_,
- then _I), II), III)_.

The `type` attribute for ordered lists in Asciidoctor,
which allows the user to specify the label of an ordered list, is ignored.

=== List items with more than one paragraph

Asciidoctor and HTML support multiple paragraphs within a single list item
(see https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#list-continuation[list continuation]).
In HTML output, all the paragraphs within a list item will be aligned.

==== MS Word caveats

- For list items containing multiple paragraphs,
  Metanorma attempts to format them appropriately by using custom list continuation styles
  (`ListContLevel1` etc.); however, you should check the output document
  and may need to manually intervene.

- In MS Word, each list entry must be a single paragraph.
  if the Asciidoctor contains more than one paragraph for a list item,
  the subsequent paragraphs will not be preceded by a bullet in Word,
  but they will also not be indented under the first paragraph of the list item.


== Tables

While Asciidoctor tables are quite powerful for a non-XML markup language,
they still have not dealt with the full range of complexity required in Metanorma.

Metanorma adds the option of multiple header rows (attribute `headerrows=n`)
to deal with the complexity of ISO tables
requiring labels, variables, and units to lining up in the header.

Asciidoc allows table cells to have footnotes (which Metanorma renders inside the table)
and notes following the table (which Metanorma moves inside the table footer).

[TIP]
====
Table 1 in the AsciiISO Rice example document illustrates
a large range of table formatting options.
====

=== Count of table header and footer rows

In Asciidoc, a table can have at most one header row or footer row. In Metanorma,
a nominal single header row is routinely broken up into multiple rows in order
to accommodate units or symbols, that line up against each other, though
they are displayed as merged cells with no grid between them. To address this,
tables can be marked up with an optional `headerrows` attribute:

[source,asciidoctor]
--
[headerrows=2]
|===
.2+|Defect 4+^| Maximum permissible mass fraction of defects in husked rice +
stem:[w_max]
| in husked rice | in milled rice (non-glutinous) | in husked parboiled rice | in milled parboiled rice

| Extraneous matter: organic footnote:[Organic extraneous matter includes foreign seeds, husks, bran, parts of straw, etc.] | 1,0 | 0,5 | 1,0 | 0,5
|===
--

== Formulae

Formulae are marked up as `[stem]` blocks. Any explanation of symbols in the formula is given as a "where" paragraph, followed by a definition list. For example:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[[formulaA-1]]
[stem]
++++
w = (m_D) / (m_s)
++++

where

stem:[w]:: is the mass fraction of grains with a particular defect in the test sample;
stem:[m_D]:: is the mass, in grams, of grains with that defect; 
stem:[m_S]:: is the mass, in grams, of the test sample. 
--

=== Notes on mathematical formatting

Mathematical formatting is done using the `[stem]` macro.
While Asciidoctor supports http://asciimath.org[AsciiMath] and LaTeX natively (AsciiMath by default),
Metanorma supports **only AsciiMath**.

AsciiMath is converted to Microsoft Word's OOXML via MathML,
using the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciimath[AsciiMath] Ruby gem;
the syntax of the Ruby gem may be at odds with the usual MathJax processor of AsciiMath.
(We have found that the Ruby gem insists on numerators being bracketed.)

== Figures

Like formulae, figures can be followed by a definition list for the variables used in the figure;
the definition list is preceded by `+*Key*+`. For example:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[[figureC-1]]
.Typical gelatinization curve
image::rice_images/rice_image2.png[]
footnote:[The time stem:[t_90] was estimated to be 18,2 min for this example.]

*Key*

stem:[w]:: mass fraction of gelatinized kernels, expressed in per cent
stem:[t]:: cooking time, expressed in minutes
stem:[t_90]:: time required to gelatinize 90 % of the kernels
P:: point of the curve corresponding to a cooking time of stem:[t_90]

NOTE: These results are based on a study carried out on three different types of kernel.
--

=== Subfigures

Subfigures (which appear in ISO) are entered by including images in an Asciidoctor example:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[[figureC-2]]
.Stages of gelatinization
====
.Initial stages: No grains are fully gelatinized (ungelatinized starch granules are visible inside the kernels)
image::rice_images/rice_image3_1.png[]

.Intermediate stages: Some fully gelatinized kernels are visible
image::rice_images/rice_image3_2.png[]

.Final stages: All kernels are fully gelatinized
image::rice_images/rice_image3_3.png[]

====
--

=== Image size

The value `auto` is accepted for image width and height attributes. It is only passed on
to HTML output; if the output is to Word, both the width and height attributes are stripped
from the image.

[source,asciidoctor]
--
[height=90,width=auto]
image::logo.jpg
--

=== Diagrams using PlantUML

The http://plantuml.com[PlantUML] diagramming tool is integrated with Asciidoctor
in this gem, as a literal block with the style attribute `plantuml`:

[source,asciidoctor]
--
[plantuml]
....
@startuml
Alice -> Bob: Authentication Request
Bob --> Alice: Authentication Response

Alice -> Bob: Another authentication Request
Alice <-- Bob: another authentication Response
@enduml
....
--

The integration runs PlantUML for each such block, generating a PNG image.
The images are stored in the `plantuml` directory, and linked into the output
document in place of the PlantUML.

[NOTE]
====
PlantUML needs to be installed by users separately, and accesssible from the
command line:

* `brew install plantuml` on MacOS.
* For Linux, link the PlantUML jar file into a command line executable; see
`.travis.yml` for an example.

If PlantUML is not installed locally, the source PlantUML is incorporated into
the output document as sourcecode.
====


== Notes

Notes that are not at the end of a clause are folded into the preceding block,
if that block is not delimited (so that the user could not choose to include or exclude a note).
That is, notes are folded into a preceding paragraph, list, formula, or figure.


== Cross-references

The guidance given in ISO/IEC DIR 2 for internal cross-references
guarantees unambiguous referencing and is followed rigorously by Metanorma.

In particular, if a formula, example, figure, list, list item or table is cross-referenced
outside its (sub)clause, the clause containing the item is always given in the cross-reference,
unless the item is being referenced in the same clause.

In the case of notes, the containing clause is extended to containing example, figure or table.

[NOTE]
====
For example, in the AsciiISO Rice model sample document
formula B.1 is defined in Annex B.6, and is referenced in B.6 and B.7.

In the Rice model document published by ISO, both instances are cited as "Formula (B.1)".
However, Metanorma follows ISO/IEC DIR 2 in citing the former
as "Formula (B.1)", but the latter as "B.6, Formula (B.1)".

In this sense, Metanorma is "more royalist than the king" in applying formatting rules and
validation—which is what you would want of a computer-based tool.
====

The label of the item cross-referenced, the use of brackets, and the containing reference
are all taken care of by Metanorma; the document author needs only give the item identifier
in the Asciidoctor source
(e.g. `<<``formulaB-1``>>` generates either "Formula (B.1)" or "B.6, Formula (B.1)",
depending on where in the document it occurs.)

=== Localities

Normally in Asciidoctor, any text in a cross-reference that follows a comma
constitutes custom text for the cross-reference.
So a cross-reference `<<ISO7301,the foregoing reference>>`
would be rendered as "the foregoing reference", and hyperlinked to the ISO7301 reference.

In Metanorma Asciidoctor cross-references, bibliographic localities
(e.g. page numbers, clause numbers) can be added directly after the comma,
as part of the cross-reference text. This overrides the normal Asciidoctor treatment of custom text.

=== List items

List items can be cross-referenced by inserting a bookmark at the very start of the list item:

[source,asciidoc]
--
. Ordered list
.. [[id]] This is the first list item
... [[id]] This is a list sub-item
--

=== Cross-references to external documents

Metanorma Asciidoctor, like normal Asciidoctor, will process cross-references to
anchors within external documents. For example,

[source,asciidoc]
--
<<document1.adoc#b>>
--

will be processed as a link to anchor `#b` in document `document1.adoc`.

If the reference uses `.adoc` suffix, as in above example, it is stripped in Metanorma XML
and substituted with the extension of the current document type during document generation.

The above example is rendered in Metanorma XML as `<xref target="document1#b">`,
in HTML as `<a href="document1.html#b">`, and in PDF as `<a href="document1.pdf#b">`.


== Reviewer notes

To annotate document with reviewer notes (essentially, arbitrary blocks of text),
Metanorma allows using Asciidoctor sidebars.

Sidebars can be separated at a distance from the text they are annotating;
the text they are annotating is indicated through anchors. 

[NOTE]
====
Reviewer notes are only rendered if the document has a `:draft:` attribute.
====

The following attributes on reviewer notes are mandatory:

* `reviewer` attribute (naming the reviewer) 
* the starting target anchor of the note (`from` attribute)

The following attributes are optional:

* `date` attribute, optionally including the time (as xs:date or xs:datetime)
* the ending target anchor of the note (`to` attribute)

The span of text covered by the reviewer note is from the start of the
text encompassed by the `from` element, to the end of the text encompassed
by the `to` element. If only the `from` element supplied, the reviewer note
covers the `from` element. The `from` and `to` elements can be bookmarks,
which cover no space.

[source,asciidoctor]
--
[[clause_address_profile_definition]]
=== Address Profile Definition (AddressProfileDescription)

[[para1]]
This is a clause address [[A]]profile[[B]] definition

[reviewer="Nick Nicholas",date=20180125T0121,from=clause_address_profile_definition,to=para1]
****
I do not agree with this statement.
****

[reviewer="Nick Nicholas",date=20180125T0121,from=A,to=B]
****
Profile?!
****
--


== Footnotes

Table and figure footnotes are treated diffferently from all other footnotes: they are
rendered at the bottom of the table or figure, and they are numbered separately.


== References & Bibliography

The Normative References and the Bibliography must be preceded by the style attribute
`[bibliography]`, so that the references they contain may be recognised as such. 

All bibliographic entries must be given as unordered lists. 

Generic references in bibliographies use bracketed numbers, like `[1]`.

Bibliographic entries for standards are expected to have the standard document
identifier as the item label.

[source,asciidoctor]
--
* [[[ref1,ISO 712]]], _Cereals and cereal products -- Determination of moisture content -- Reference method_
--

[TIP]
====
Currently the gem only supports formatted citations, which are given as such in the Asciidoc source.
In the future, we expect to integrate the documents with rendering of Relaton-model bibliographies,
so that the text of the citation itself doesn’t have to be entered by hand.
====

=== Localities

Citations can include details of where in the document the citation is located (or the word “whole”);
these are entered by suffixing the lowercase type of locality, then an equals sign,
then the locality value or range of values.

Multiple instances of locality and reference can be provided, delimited by comma or colon.
Any trailing text after the sequence of locality=reference (or locality, space, reference)
is treated as substitute text, as would occur normally in an Asciidoctor cross-reference.

The locality can appear in quotations if it contains special characters (like dashes or commas).
For example:

[source,asciidoctor]
--
<<ISO7301,clause=3.1-3.4>>

NOTE: This table is based on <<ISO7301,table=1>>.

Sampling shall be carried out in accordance with <<xxx,section="5-3-1,bis">>
--

More examples:

[source,asciidoctor]
--
<<ISO712,the foregoing reference>>     # renders as: the foregoing reference
<<ISO712,section=5, page 8-10>>         # renders as: ISO 712, Section 5, Page 8-10
<<ISO712,section=5, page=8-10: 5:8-10>> # renders as ISO 712, 5:8-10 ("5:8-10" treated as replacement text for all the foregoing)
<<ISO712,whole>>                        # renders as: ISO 712, Whole of text
--

The references cannot contain spaces. Any text following the sequence of localities
will be displayed instead of the localities.

A custom locality can be entered by prefixing it with `locality:`:

[source,asciidoctor]
--
<<ISO712,locality:frontispiece=5, page=8-10>>         # renders as: ISO 712, Frontispiece 5, Page 8-10
--

Custom localities may not contain commas, colons, or space. Localities with the `locality:`
prefix are recognised in internationalisation configuration files.

Any text after the bibliographic localities is still treated as custom cross-reference text;
for example:

[source,asciidoctor]
--
<<ISO7301,clause=5,table=1,the foregoing reference>>
--

=== Referencing established standards

References to well-defined standards codes use the document identifiers
(e.g. `ISO 20483:2013`) for citations.

==== Automatic reference lookup

For references to certain standards, Metanorma will attempt to look up references online
during document build.

By default, the https://github.com/riboseinc/relaton[`relaton`] gem is used to look up the reference details for
standards known to have online bibliographies. For bibliographic standards to be looked up via relaton,
the standard document identifier needs to be encoded in a format recognised by relaton as a key:

* For ISO: `ISO(identifier)`, or any identifier prefixed with `ISO`
* For IEC: `IEC(identifier)`, or any identifier prefixed with `IEC`
* For IETF: `IETF(identifier)` (e.g. `IETF(I-D.-burger-xcon-mmodels)`), or any identifier prefixed with `RFC`
* For GB: `CN(identifier)` (e.g. `CN(JB/T 13368-2018)`)

The full bibliographic details of the item are screenscraped from the online bibliography and inserted into the XML file 
(although only the title of the reference is used in rendering).

In addition, if any entries in Terms and Definitions cite the International Electrotechnical Vocabulary (IEV),
the http://www.electropedia.org[IEV Electropedia] termbank is queried during validation, to confirm
that the cited entries are the same as what is cited online; those queries are routed through the `iev` gem.

===== Caching

The results of all `relaton` searches done to date, across all documents,
are cached in the global cache file `~/.relaton/cache`,  
so they do not need to be re-fetched each time a document is processed.
(The web query takes a few seconds per reference.)

The results of all `relaton` searches done to date in a given directory
are stored in the same directory as the current document,
by default to the file `relaton/cache`. (The filename can be overriden in
document attributes.) The local cache overrides entries in
the global cache, and can be manually edited. The local cache is only used
if the `:local-cache:` or `:local-cache-only:` document attribute is set.

If the document attribute `:no-isobib:` is set, the reference details for
items are not looked up via `isobib`, and the `isobib` caches are not used.
If the document attribute `:no-isobib-cache:` is set, the reference details for
items are still looked up via `isobib`, but the `isobib` caches are not used.

Any entry in the cache that corresponds to an undated ISO reference fetches its details
from the latest available entry on the ISO web site. If the entry is more than 60
days old, it is refetched.

The results of all `iev` searches done to date across all documents are cached
in the global cache fule `~/iev.pstore`, and the results of all `iev` searches
done to date for the current document are stored in the same directory as the
current document, in the file `(filename).iev.pstore`.

== Annexes

All annexes must be preceded by the style attribute `[appendix]`.

Like all clauses, annexes are **normative by default**,
an informative annex is indicated with `[appendix,obligation=informative]`.

The **numbering** of annexes and appendices is automatic:
do not insert "Annex A" or "Appendix 1" as part of the title.

Annex and Appendix **titles** can be left blank, as with Clauses.
