== Visual Presentation

=== Cover page images

Any images to be included in the cover page are to be given under the
document attribute `coverpage-image`, as a comma-delimited list:

[source,asciidoctor]
----
:coverpage-image: images/image1.gif,images/image2.gif
----

The inner cover images, ToC side images, and back page images are treated in the same way,
with the respective atttributes `innercoverpage-image`, `tocside-image`, and `backpage-image`.

Note that even if an `:imagesdir:` directory is specified, the image locations should be given
relative to the source document, for consistency with other attributes.

=== Font
BSI documents require the BSI Gesta font to be installed in order to render HTML and PDF
outputs correctly. The BSI Gesta font cannot be freely distributed, but can be made available
for use under Metanorma by requesting access to the repository https://github.com/metanorma/fontist-formulas-private

Once you have access to that repository, execute the following commands to make the BSI Gesta font
available to Metanorma:

[source,console]
----
fontist repo setup metanorma https://github.com/metanorma/fontist-formulas-private
fontist repo update metanorma
fontist install "BSI Gesta"
----

=== Boilerplate text

By default, coverpage and frontispiece text is automatically added by Metanorma. That includes copyright information,
draft notices, and contact information about the BSI.

BSI Flex standards include inside front cover material specific to that type of standard, as required by the current Flex style guide:

____
e) a description of the programme, if applicable, worded as follows:
   This BSI Flex is part of a wider programme of work around XXXX. For more information, go
   to: https://www.bsigroup.com/XXX

f) a link to the project website, worded as follows;
   Information on the development of this BSI Flex can be found at:
   https://www.bsigroup.com/XXX

g) a statement about BSI Flex standards, worded as follows:
   BSI Flex standards provide a new, flexible way to develop consensus-based good practice
   that dynamically adapts to keep pace with fast-changing markets. For more information, go to:
   https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/our-services/standards-services/flex/
____

Because there is variability in this information, including whether e) and f) are distinct paragraphs,
the text for e) and f) should be entered as a preface clause of type "flex-coverpage"; any title provided will
be ignored. For example:

[source,asciidoctor]
----
[.preface,type="flex-coverpage"]
== Flex cover page

This BSI Flex is part of a wider programme of work around CAVs. For more information, go
to: https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/CAV/
----

The text for g) is the same for all BSI Flex standards, and is supplied automatically after the information
in e) and f).

== Clauses

=== Corrigenda

Corrigenda are specified by a prefatory clause, of type "corrigenda":

[source,asciidoctor]
----
[.preface,type=corrigenda]
== Amendments/corrigenda issued since publication
[[tab_ace_nat]]
[cols="1,1",options="header,unnumbered"]
|===
|Date |Text affected

=== Sections

Sections are signalled through floating titles with a "section" option. The "Section _n_" heading of the title
is prefixed automatically; if it is missing, the title is left blank.

[source,asciidoc]
----
[discrete%section]
== {blank}

=== Term sources

Term sources can be not only identical relative to their original; they can also be adapted, quoted,
or modified.  These are indicated as follows:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[.source%adapted]

== Blocks

=== Commentaries

Commentaries are entered as notes of type `commentary`,
with an optional `target` attribute,
giving the anchor of the block the commentary is referencing. If no target
is given, the commentary is assumed to be about the subclause containing it.

=== Lists

Ordered lists are by default numbered according to BSI 0.2 Clause 23: rotating between
alphabetic, then arabic, then roman, both for multiple ordered lists at the same level,
and for levels of nesting within ordered lists.

The styling can be overridden using attributes as is normal in Asciidoctor, e.g.
`[loweralpha]`, but in that case Metanorma will issue a warning.

Ordered lists in BSI support the `start` attribute, to restart numbering; the value
of start is always numeric, regardless of how the list numbering is rendered.
