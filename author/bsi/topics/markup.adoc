== Visual Presentation

=== Cover page images

Any images to be included in the cover page are to be given under the
document attribute `coverpage-image`, as a comma-delimited list:

[source,asciidoctor]
----
:coverpage-image: images/image1.gif,images/image2.gif
----

The inner cover images, Table of Contents side images, and back page images are treated in the same way,
with the respective atttributes `innercoverpage-image`, `tocside-image`, and `backpage-image`.

Note that even if an `:imagesdir:` directory is specified, the image locations should be given
relative to the source document, for consistency with other attributes.

=== Font
BSI documents require the BSI Gesta font to be installed in order to render HTML and PDF
outputs correctly. The BSI Gesta font cannot be freely distributed, but can be made available
for use under Metanorma by requesting access to the repository https://github.com/metanorma/fontist-formulas-private

Once you have access to that repository, execute the following commands to make the BSI Gesta font
available to Metanorma:

[source,console]
----
fontist repo setup metanorma https://github.com/metanorma/fontist-formulas-private
fontist repo update metanorma
fontist install "BSI Gesta"
----

=== Boilerplate text

By default, coverpage and frontispiece text is automatically added by Metanorma. That includes copyright information,
draft notices, and contact information about the BSI.

BSI Flex standards include inside front cover material specific to that type of standard, as required by the current Flex style guide:

____
e) a description of the programme, if applicable, worded as follows:
   This BSI Flex is part of a wider programme of work around XXXX. For more information, go
   to: https://www.bsigroup.com/XXX

f) a link to the project website, worded as follows;
   Information on the development of this BSI Flex can be found at:
   https://www.bsigroup.com/XXX

g) a statement about BSI Flex standards, worded as follows:
   BSI Flex standards provide a new, flexible way to develop consensus-based good practice
   that dynamically adapts to keep pace with fast-changing markets. For more information, go to:
   https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/our-services/standards-services/flex/
____

Because there is variability in this information, including whether e) and f) are distinct paragraphs,
the text for e) and f) should be entered as a preface clause of type "flex-coverpage"; any title provided will
be ignored. For example:

[source,asciidoctor]
----
[.preface,type="flex-coverpage"]
== Flex cover page

This BSI Flex is part of a wider programme of work around CAVs. For more information, go
to: https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/CAV/
----

The text for g) is the same for all BSI Flex standards, and is supplied automatically after the information
in e) and f).

BSI Flex and PAS documents also include a publication history (labelled "Release history" in BSI Flex);
it appears after g) in BSI Flex, and in the bottom of the Publication and Copyright Information.
The publication history is enterd with a preface clause of type "publication-history"; any title
supplied is overwritten with the title specific to the document type. For example:

[source,asciidoctor]
----
[.preface,type="publication-history"]
== Release history

First published November 2001

Second edition January 2006

== Clauses

=== Adoption forewords

When BSI adopts a standard from another SDO, it may insert its own foreword before the foreword
of the original document. If the standard has been adopted via a regional SDO such as CEN,
that regional SDO may have already added its own foreword.

In order to ensure that the national and regional forewords are shown before the original foreword,
they need to be specified as prefatory clauses, of type "national-foreword" and "regional-foreword".
The `== Foreword` markup is retained for the source document. (Marking it as `.preface` is optional,
as Metanorma already recognises `== Foreword` as a prefatory clause. Marking the National and Regional 
forewords as `.preface` is mandatory.)

[source,asciidoctor]
----
[.preface,type=national-foreword]
== National foreword

BSI has adopted...

[.preface,type=regional-foreword]
== Regional foreword

CEN has adopted...

[.preface]
== Foreword
The ISO standard...
----

=== Corrigenda

Corrigenda are specified by a first-level prefatory clause, of type "corrigenda":

[source,asciidoctor]
----
[.preface,type=corrigenda]
== Amendments/corrigenda issued since publication
[[tab_ace_nat]]
[cols="1,1",options="header,unnumbered"]

=== Forewords

Forewords in BSI typically consist of multiple subclauses, which are not numbered. These subclauses do
not need to have types allocated to them, as they are not at this time processed any differently.

The following is a representative foreword with subclauses:

[source,asciidoctor]
----
== Foreword

=== Publishing information

=== Supersession

=== Relationship with other publications

=== Information about this document

=== Hazard warnings

=== Use of this document

=== Presentational conventions

=== Contractual and legal considerations

// Not a clause heading!
*Compliance with a British Standard cannot confer immunity from legal obligations.*
----

=== Sections

Sections are signalled through floating titles with a "section" option. The "Section _n_" heading of the title
is prefixed automatically; if it is missing, the title is left blank.

[source,asciidoc]
----
[discrete%section]
== {blank}

== Clause

[discrete%section]
== Added Considerations
----

rendered as

____
*Section 1*

*Clause 1*

*Section 2. Added Considerations*
____

=== Term sources

Term sources can be not only identical relative to their original; they can also be adapted, quoted,
or modified.  These are indicated as follows:

=== Colophon sections

Expert commentaries are expected to include colophon sections: Author, technical reviewers, disclaimers:

== Blocks

=== Commentaries

Commentaries are entered as notes of type `commentary`,
with an optional `target` attribute,
giving the anchor of the block the commentary is referencing. If no target
is given, the commentary is assumed to be about the subclause containing it.

=== Foreword notes

BSI requires certain templated language to be incorporated into the foreword if applicable.
Of these, the paragraphs relating to _Product certification/inspection/testing_,
_Assessed capability_ and _Test laboratory accreditation_ should be entered as notes,
without their labels, and with the right type: `product-certification, `assessed-capability`,
`test-lab-accreditation`.

=== Lists

Ordered lists are by default numbered according to BSI 0.2 Clause 23: rotating between
alphabetic, then arabic, then roman, both for multiple ordered lists at the same level,
and for levels of nesting within ordered lists.

The styling can be overridden using attributes as is normal in Asciidoctor, e.g.
`[loweralpha]`, but in that case Metanorma will issue a warning.

Ordered lists in BSI support the `start` attribute, to restart numbering; the value
of start is always numeric, regardless of how the list numbering is rendered.

=== Figures

Figures can optionally have a `width` attribute, with legal values `full-page-width`, `narrow`,
and `text-width` (default).
