== Visual Presentation

=== Cover page images

Any images to be included in the cover page are to be given under the
document attribute `coverpage-image`, as a comma-delimited list:

[source,asciidoctor]
----
:coverpage-image: images/image1.gif,images/image2.gif
----

=== Font
BSI documents require the BSI Gesta font to be installed in order to render HTML and PDF
outputs correctly. The BSI Gesta font cannot be freely distributed, but can be made available
for use under Metanorma by requesting access to the repository https://github.com/metanorma/fontist-formulas-private

Once you have access to that repository, execute the following commands to make the BSI Gesta font
available to Metanorma:

[source,console]
----
fontist repo setup metanorma https://github.com/metanorma/fontist-formulas-private
fontist repo update metanorma
fontist install "BSI Gesta"
