== Visual Presentation

=== Cover page images

Any images to be included in the cover page are to be given under the
document attribute `coverpage-image`, as a comma-delimited list:

[source,asciidoctor]
----
:coverpage-image: images/image1.gif,images/image2.gif
----

=== Font
BSI documents require the BSI Gesta font to be installed in order to render HTML and PDF
outputs correctly. The BSI Gesta font cannot be freely distributed, but can be made available
for use under Metanorma by requesting access to the repository https://github.com/metanorma/fontist-formulas-private

Once you have access to that repository, execute the following commands to make the BSI Gesta font
available to Metanorma:

[source,console]
----
fontist repo setup metanorma https://github.com/metanorma/fontist-formulas-private
fontist repo update metanorma
fontist install "BSI Gesta"
----


== Clauses

== Blocks

=== Commentaries

Commentaries are entered as notes of type `commentary`,
with an optional `target` attribute,
giving the anchor of the block the commentary is referencing. If no target
is given, the commentary is assumed to be about the subclause containing it.

=== Lists

Ordered lists are by default numbered according to BSI 0.2 Clause 23: rotating between
alphabetic, then arabic, then roman, both for multiple ordered lists at the same level,
and for levels of nesting within ordered lists.

The styling can be overridden using attributes as is normal in Asciidoctor, e.g.
`[loweralpha]`, but in that case Metanorma will issue a warning.

Ordered lists in BSI support the `start` attribute, to restart numbering; the value
of start is always numeric, regardless of how the list numbering is rendered.
