There are two AsciiDoc image macro types, block and inline. 

== Block image
tag::tutorial[]
A block image is displayed as a discrete element, i.e., on its own line, in a document. A block image is designated by image macro name and followed by two colons (`::`) It’s preceded by a blank line, entered on a line by itself, and then followed by a blank line.

However, in standard documents images don’t just decorate text, but rather show important features. You might want to reference that image in the text, which you need an anchor for. You can also explain a graphic by adding a key. The entries of the key follow the syntax of a definition list (`key::Explanation`).

== Inline image macro

An inline image is displayed in the flow of another element, such as a paragraph. This is useful when you want to incorporate buttons or other icons into the text flow. 

The inline image macro is almost identical to the block image macro, except its macro name is followed by a single colon (:). For more information refer to the https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/images/[AsciiDoc documentation].

== Figures

Like formulae, figures can be followed by a definition list for the variables used in the figure;
the definition list is either preceded by the paragraph `+*Key*+` (in English),
or [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.6.3] is marked up with `[%key]`.
For example:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[[figureC-1]]
.Typical gelatinization curve
image::rice_images/rice_image2.png[alt text]
footnote:[The time stem:[t_90] was estimated to be 18,2 min for this example.]

[%key]
stem:[w]:: mass fraction of gelatinized kernels, expressed in per cent
stem:[t]:: cooking time, expressed in minutes
stem:[t_90]:: time required to gelatinize 90 % of the kernels
P:: point of the curve corresponding to a cooking time of stem:[t_90]

NOTE: These results are based on a study carried out on three different types of kernel.

As an extension to AsciiDoc syntax, Metanorma allows Data URLs as the URL for an image:

[source,asciidoc]
--
image::data:image/png;base64,ivBO[alt text]
--

=== Subfigures

Subfigures (which appear in ISO formats, for example)
are entered by including images in AsciiDoc examples.

[source,asciidoc]

.Stages of gelatinization
====
.Initial stages: No grains are fully gelatinized (ungelatinized starch granules are visible inside the kernels)
image::rice_images/rice_image3_1.png[]

.Intermediate stages: Some fully gelatinized kernels are visible
image::rice_images/rice_image3_2.png[]

.Final stages: All kernels are fully gelatinized
image::rice_images/rice_image3_3.png[]

=== Image size

The value `auto` is accepted for image width and height attributes. It is only passed on
to HTML output; if the output is to Word, both the width and height attributes are stripped
from the image.

[source,asciidoc]
--
[height=90,width=auto]
image::logo.jpg
--

=== Captions and titles

As elsewhere in Metanorma, the caption of an image (of the figure containing the image)
is set with a line prefixed with dot above the image.

[source,asciidoc]
--
.Caption
image::logo.jpg[]
--

[source,asciidoc]
--
image::logo.jpg[title=Caption]
--

NOTE: Similar to Asciidoctor AsciiDoc, the `title` attribute is treated as
identical to the dot-prefixed caption.


Metanorma supports a `title` attribute on images for accessibility, which is
distinct from the figure caption.
This is entered in Metanorma as the `titleattr` attribute:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[titleattr=Title Attribute]
image::logo.jpg
--

Or

[source,asciidoc]
--
image::logo.jpg[titleattr=Title Attribute]
--

Both captions and titles could be used together.

[source,asciidoc]
--
.Rice husk separation in rice farm at Breton near Dinan
image::logo.jpg[titleattr=Photo of rice husks being separated]
--

NOTE: The `titleattr` attribute does not get rendered in Word output due to Word
limitations. Word only supports a single image "`Alt Text`", which would be set
by the caption.
Word's description of "`Alt Text`" is:
"`How would you describe this object and its context to someone who is blind?`".


== Preformatted blocks

Figures can include preformatted blocks, as well as images.

For accessibility, preformatted blocks can be provided with an alt text attribute
[added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.3.10].
