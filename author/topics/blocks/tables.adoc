Tables are a useful tool to collect and display measured data. As AsciiDoc is all text input, it uses specific symbols to determine where new table rows and columns begin. A simple table looks like this:

[source, AsciiDoc]
----
[cols="1,1"] <1>
.A table with a title <2>
|=== <3>
|Cell in column 1, header row |Cell in column 2, header row <4>

|Cell in column 1, row 2 
|Cell in column 2, row 2 <5>
|=== <6>
----
<1> Attribute that specifies the table. `[cols="1,1"]` tells the compiler that there are two columns `cols=”x,x”` that should appear in equal amount of spacing. For example, `[cols="4,2,4"]` would define three columns. The first and last column’s width would be four times the relative width and the middle column would be half as broad. This attribute is optional.
<2> You can add a table title by beginning the line with a dot `.`. Make sure that there is no space between the dot and the first word of the heading. 
<3> Starting delimiter `|===`
<4> The first line after the delimiter is the header row. To add a column, add a vertical bar `|` before the text that should be in the column. If you use the `[cols]` attribute, different cells in a row can appear on different lines of AsciiDoc text; otherwise, they need to all be on the same line of text.
<5> If you deal with larger amounts of text, you can also start the next column in the new line.
<6> Closing delimiter `|===`

Since standardization documents can get a bit complex, Metanorma AsciiDoc provides additional metadata for tables: 
* `headerrows` defines how many table rows are headers
* `alt` defines the alt text that is shown when the table can not be displayed (HTML only)
* `width` defines the total width of the table in relation to the whole page. 

.Example of a more complex table
[source, AsciiDoc]
----
[headerrows=2,alt=Table of maximum mass fraction of defects in husked rice,width=70%]
|===
.2+|Defect 4+^| Maximum permissible mass fraction of defects in husked rice +
stem:[w_max]
| in husked rice | in milled rice (non-glutinous) | in husked parboiled rice | in milled parboiled rice

| Extraneous matter: organic | 1,0 | 0,5 | 1,0 | 0,5

|===
----

The table renders as:

[headerrows=2,alt=Table of maximum mass fraction of defects in husked rice,width=70%]
|===
.2+|Defect 4+^| Maximum permissible mass fraction of defects in husked rice +
stem:[w_max]
| in husked rice | in milled rice (non-glutinous) | in husked parboiled rice | in milled parboiled rice

| Extraneous matter: organic | 1,0 | 0,5 | 1,0 | 0,5

== Tables

Metanorma AsciiDoc tables are required to handle the full range of complexity
of standardization documents, and is therefore significantly more
powerful than typical AsciiDoc tables, even when typical AsciiDoc already
handles tables very well for a non-XML markup language.

Metanorma AsciiDoc already supports cells spanning multiple rows and columns,
horizontal alignment, and [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.5.3]
vertical alignment.

Metanorma AsciiDoc adds the option of multiple header rows
via attribute `headerrows` to deal with the complexity
of standardization documents' tables
requiring labels, variables, and units to lining up in the header.

Tables can also have alternate text as a title, `alt`, and summary text,
`summary`, both of which are to be rendered as a summary of the table
for accessibility.

Tables can be set with a `width` attribute, which could be either a
percentage (e.g. `70%`) or a pixel count (e.g. `500px`). [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.3.21].

NOTE: The `width` attribute value aligns with HTML CSS and HTML 4 behavior.

which renders:

In Metanorma AsciiDoc:

* table cell footnotes are rendered inside the table;
* notes following the table are rendered inside the table footer.

NOTE: Typical AsciiDoc renders table cell footnotes inside the cell,
and notes trailing the table outside the table.

[TIP]
====
Table 1 in the Metanorma ISO Rice example document illustrates
a large range of table formatting options.
====

Table columns can also have their widths set [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.5.3].
Table column widths must be enumerated explicitly per column to generate column widths.

EXAMPLE:

The following syntax will be processed as generating equal width columns.

[source,adoc]
----
[cols="1,1,1"]
----

NOTE: In typical AsciiDoc, `[cols="3"]` is considered a shorthand to
`[cols="1,1,1"]`, but this is not supported in Metanorma AsciiDoc.
