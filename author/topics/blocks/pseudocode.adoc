== Pseudocode

Pseudocode is a mix between formal math with code like properties commonly
used in computer science and related fields.

Unlike source code, pseudocode is typically in a proportional font, but it
still needs to be indented to reflect code structure.
Moreover, pseudocode typically requires source code highlighting
such as boldface; but unlike well-defined computer languages, there is no
guaranteed way of automating such highlighting.

Pseudocode is supported in Metanorma using the `pseudocode` block with these
properties:

* text within a pseudocode block is treated as normal text, including
  respect for inline formatting;

* lines do not need to be separated by line breaks, although two carriage
  returns in a row are still interpreted as a new
  paragraph. [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.3.10]

* indentation spaces at the start of each line are preserved, by converting
  them into non-breaking spaces; initial tabs are converted into four
  non-breaking spaces.

The syntax is as follows:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[pseudocode]
====
normal text
  stem:[math]
    _italics_ [smallcap]#small caps text#
*bolded text*
