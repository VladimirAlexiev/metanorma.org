== Figures

=== General

In standardization documents, figures are used as document elements to present
non-textual material so that they are independently referable.

In Metanorma, the usage of the `image` command will result in a figure.
Please refer to link:/author/topics/blocks/images[images] for details
of the `image` command.



=== Key

Like formulae, figures can be followed by a definition list for the variables used in the figure.
This definition list is marked up with `[%key]` [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.6.3].

The syntax is as follows:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[[some-anchor]] <1>
.Figure title <2>
image::figure-path.png[] <3>

[%key] <4>
{some-id}:: {some-description} <5>
--
<1> Optional anchor for referencing
<2> Title of the figure
<3> The image command with path
<4> Specification of figure key section
<5> Key entry: `{some-description}` is text that describes information about the thing
represented by `{some-id}`

footnote:[The time stem:[t_90] was estimated to be 18,2 min for this example.]

[%key]
stem:[w]:: mass fraction of gelatinized kernels, expressed in per cent
stem:[t]:: cooking time, expressed in minutes
stem:[t_90]:: time required to gelatinize 90 % of the kernels
P:: point of the curve corresponding to a cooking time of stem:[t_90]

NOTE: These results are based on a study carried out on three different types of kernel.

The key definition list can also be preceded by a paragraph consisting of
`\*Key*`, though that is not recommended.

*Key*

stem:[w]:: mass fraction of gelatinized kernels, expressed in per cent
stem:[t]:: cooking time, expressed in minutes
stem:[t_90]:: time required to gelatinize 90 % of the kernels
P:: point of the curve corresponding to a cooking time of stem:[t_90]

=== Discursive figures

A discursive figure, containing text as well as images, can be marked up as an
example, with a `[.figure]` role [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.0.7]:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[.figure]
.Typical gelatinization curve
====
image::rice_images/rice_image2.png[alt text]

This is lots of discursive text

=== Subfigures

Subfigures (which appear in ISO formats, for example) are entered by including
images in an example block.

.Stages of gelatinization
====
.Initial stages: No grains are fully gelatinized (ungelatinized starch granules are visible inside the kernels)
image::rice_images/rice_image3_1.png[]

.Intermediate stages: Some fully gelatinized kernels are visible
image::rice_images/rice_image3_2.png[]

.Final stages: All kernels are fully gelatinized
image::rice_images/rice_image3_3.png[]

=== Preformatted blocks

Figures can include preformatted blocks, as well as images.

For accessibility, preformatted blocks can be provided with an `alt` text
attribute [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.3.10].

/      /  \___ _/

=== Figure classes

Figures in documents can belong to different classes (e.g. _Plate_, _Chart_, _Diagram_),
each of which can be auto-numbered and captioned differently. In order to achieve this,
the desired class can be indicated
through the `class` attribute [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.2.5].
