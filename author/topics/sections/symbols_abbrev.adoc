== Symbols and abbreviations

=== General

The symbols and abbreviations section is identified with the pre-defined
section titles:

* `Symbols and abbreviated terms`
* `Symbols` [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.5.0]
* `Abbreviated terms` [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.5.0]

=== Format

Symbols and Abbreviations sections are expected to be simple definition lists
(http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#labeled-list["`labelled lists`"]
in AsciiDoc nomenclature).

Metanorma takes care of sorting the symbol entries in the order prescribed by
ISO/IEC DIR 2, provided the symbols are in AsciiMath.

NOTE: Sorting MathML and LaTeX math entries is not currently supported.

The syntax of the section is:

[source,adoc]

== Symbols and abbreviations

symbol1:: text1
symbol2:: text2
stem:[symbol3]:: text3
