== Misc container

=== General

By default the single prefatory clause is identified with the pre-defined
section titles:

* `Misc-Container`

[[misc-container]]
=== Misc-Container

The `misc-container` element in Metanorma XML contains miscellaneous data
necessary for the processing of the document, that are not themselves part of
the document.

Examples include the https://www.unitsml.org/[UnitsML]
definitions of units referenced in the document, or identifiers used as aliases of anchors in the document.

If a preface clause is named `Misc-Container` (case-insensitive), its contents
are appended to the `misc-container` element for the document [added in
https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.2.7]. This can be
used to add data into a document that is not to be rendered, but which is still
needed for processing.
