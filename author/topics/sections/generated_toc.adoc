title: Table of Contents generated from Section Headings
---

Metanorma generates a table of contents automatically for Word, HTML, and PDF output based on the section headings.

* In Word, it takes the form of a normal Word Table of Contents. After generating the Word output, the page numbers are not populated. You need to refresh the table of contents by right-clicking on a field and choosing `Update Field`.

* In HTML, the table of contents takes the form of a side panel. 

* In PDF, it takes the form of an introductory table of contents.

By default, the table of contents includes two levels of heading. 
More levels of heading can be set by using the document attribute `:toclevels:`; e.g.
`:toclevels: 3` for three levels of heading included. The number of levels of heading
to include can be set separately for HTML/PDF and for DOC, by using the document
attributes `:htmltoclevels:` and `:doctoclevels:`.
