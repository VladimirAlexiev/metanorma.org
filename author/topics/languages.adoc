= Languages & localization

Metanorma allows generation of standards in different languages.

The language of the document is specified in following link:/author/ref/document-attributes/#languages-localization[document attributes]:

- `:language:` — two-letter language code, such as `en` (default) or `fr`.
- `:script:` — script (for languages with more than one script). Specify
  `Hans` for Simplified Chinese. Default is `Latn`.
- `:i18nyaml:` — language template file. Only needed if you’re using a language other than
  English, Chinese (Simplified) or French.
