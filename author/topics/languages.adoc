= Languages & localization

Metanorma allows generation of standards in different languages.

For each language, language-specific templates are specified for boilerplate text,
labels and cross-references that are included in document output.

== Specifying document language

The language of the document is specified in following link:/author/ref/document-attributes/#languages-localization[document attributes]:

- `:language:`
- `:script:` (for languages with more than one script)

== Supported languages

Metanorma has predefined templates for English, Chinese (Simplified) and French.
The Chinese (Simplified) template localises punctuation and spacing,
mapping them away from the default Latin punctuation used normally in Metanorma.

== Adding a language

You can add a new language by providing a YAML template file
and linking to that file with the `:i18nyaml:` link:/author/ref/document-attributes/#languages-localization[document attribute].

See https://github.com/riboseinc/metanorma-iso/blob/master/spec/examples/english.yaml[sample YAML file for English],
where "Foreword" is replaced with "Frontispiece",
under `metanorma-iso` repositoryâ€™s examples directory.
