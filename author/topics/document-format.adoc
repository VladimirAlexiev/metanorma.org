  <p>
  This is a general guidance for authoring Metanorma documents.

  <p>
  Since Metanorma uses AsciiDoc markup
  (see <a href="/author/approach/">Approach</a> for technical background),
  this section details the specific ways in which Metanorma interprets AsciiDoc markup,
  as well as custom markup directives.
  
  <p>
  This section applies across most of the
  <a href="/flavours/">officially supported flavours of Metanorma</a>.
  If you are using one of those flavours,
  be sure to also check out guidelines for your flavour.

= Document format

== Unsupported AsciiDoc features

* Sidebars (`aside`s) are not supported: they have been repurposed for link:./reviewer-notes/[reviewer comments].
* Page breaks (`thematic break`) are not supported.
* ASCII art/preformatted text (`literal`) are not supported in most Metanorma flavours.

== Autonumbering

Autonumbering in Metanorma extends to formulas (which are encoded as "stem" blocks) and notes.
Autonumbering is applied in the conversion from Metanorma XML to output formats (`isodoc`);
by default it restarts for each annex, but is continuous for the main body of text.
