title: Adding Document Sections
---

tag::tutorial[]
Sections define hierarchy levels in your document and are equivalent to chapters. The document title is the highest section and is created by prepending a `=` sign in front of the heading. If you want to go one level deeper in the hierarchy, add another `=`. 
Here’s an example: 

[source, AsciiDoc]
----
= Document title
== Section 1
=== Section 1.1
==== Section 1.1.1
===== Section 1.1.1.1
== Section 2
…
----

== Section headings and validation

Metanorma provides a document model that determines what sections need to appear in a document. Let’s have a look at the standard document model (standoc) to understand what kinds of sections appear in a typical Metanorma document.

NOTE: The standoc flavour does not correspond to any one SDO: it is a default model that other flavors are based on.

A typical Metanorma document can contain the following sections:

* Abstract
* Foreword
* Introduction
* Acknowledgments
* Scope
* Normative references
* Terms and definitions
* Definitions
* Clauses 
* Symbols and abbreviated terms
* Bibliography
* Annex

To successfully validate a document, the compiler needs to know what sections are in the document. Metanorma relies on these predefined section titles to check them against the document model. However, not all sections need an identifier, for example, your ordinary content sections fall under the category of `clause section`, and are not further standardized.

NOTE: Each organization is based on the standard document model but they can omit sections or make them mandatory, if they choose to. For example, only NIST uses the acknowledgments section, whereas other SDOs do not require it. Flavours may overrule these pre-defined section titles with titles of their own, or may choose not to recognise at least some of them as special sections. Check the https://www.metanorma.org/flavors/[flavor documentation] for more details on how your SDO uses Metanorma. 

== Deviating section titles

If you want to use a different title or create a document in a language other than English, you need to add metadata in square brackets to ensure that sections are recognized. Plain AsciiDoc already provides some https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/sections/section-ref/#section-styles[section metadata] that Metanorma uses for document validation: 

* `[abstract]`
* `[acknowledgments]`
* `[appendix]`
* `[bibliography]`
* `[index]`
* `[preface]`

Documents can contain only one Abstract, one Acknowledgements section, and one Index. On the other hand, documents can have any number of appendixes (or annexes), bibliographies, and prefatory sections, each of them marked with those attributes.
There are also some Metanorma-specific section identifiers, that follow the syntax `[heading=section]`:

* `[heading=terms and definitions]`
* `[heading=foreword]`
* `[heading=introduction]`
* `[heading=scope]`
* `[heading=symbols and abbreviated terms]`

[source, AsciiDoc]
----
= Document title

== Abstract

== Foreword

[preface] <1>
== Introduction to version 3 of this standard

[bibliography] <2>
== Normative references

[heading=terms and definitions] <3>
== Terms, definitions, and abbreviations

[bibliography]
== Bibliography
	...
[appendix,obligation=informative] <4>
== Annex
	...
----

<1> This section is an introduction but the compiler can not recognize it because it deviates from plain `== Introduction`. The `preface` attribute ensures that the document structure is still valid.
<2> The `Normative references` section contains references to related standards. The compiler needs the `[bibliography]` tag, so that it renders the reference correctly.
<3> Use the `heading` tag to assign section types specific to Metanorma.
<4> Here, the appendix is called “Annex”, and needs the `appendix` tag to define what kind of section it is. You can specify if a section is normative or informative by adding the `obligation` identifier after the section identifier.

[NOTE]
====
The above section titles as detected by Metanorma are case-insensitive.
While ISO Directives Part 2 demands clause titles to be in
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Sentence_case[sentence case],
some organizations utilize
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Title_case[title case].
====

=== Blank subclause headings

Blank subclause headings are used when you want to give a subclause number for a new subclause, but without an associated header text. For example,

[source,asciidoc]
--
=== Physical and chemical characteristics

==== {blank}

The mass fraction of moisture, determined in accordance with...
--

renders as

____
*4.2. Physical and chemical characteristics*

*4.2.1.*  The mass fraction of moisture, determined in accordance with...
____

[NOTE]
====
This notation should not be used to implement paragraph numbering as required for e.g. metanorma-un.
The link:/flavors/un/[UN Metanorma flavor] treats each paragraph
as a distinct clause and automatically numbers it.
====

== Sections deeper than 5 levels

Standards can contain many levels of embedding: ISO/IEC DIR 2 only considers
it a problem if there are more than 7 levels of embedding.

To realise higher levels of embedding,
prefix a 5-level section title with the attribute `level=`:

NOTE: Asciidoctor AsciiDoc permits only five levels of section embedding
(not counting the document title).


[source,asciidoc]
--
// Six equal signs for five levels
====== Clause 5A

[level=6]
====== Clause 6A

[level=7]
====== Clause 7A

[level=7]
====== Clause 7B

[level=6]
====== Clause 6B

====== Clause 5B
--

This generates the following ISO XML:

[source,xml]
--
<clause id="_" inline-header="false" obligation="normative">
	<title>
		Clause 5
	</title>
	<clause id="_" inline-header="false" obligation="normative">
		<title>
			Clause 6
		</title>
		<clause id="_" inline-header="false" obligation="normative">
			<title>
				Clause 7A
			</title>
		</clause>
		<clause id="_" inline-header="false" obligation="normative">
			<title>
				Clause 7B
			</title>
		</clause>
	</clause>
	<clause id="_" inline-header="false" obligation="normative">
		<title>
			Clause 6B
		</title>
	</clause>
</clause>
<clause id="_" inline-header="false" obligation="normative">
	<title>
		Clause 5B
	</title>
</clause>
--

and the rendering would be something like

*1.1.1.1.1  Clause 5A*

*1.1.1.1.1.1  Clause 6A*

1.1.1.1.1.1.1  Clause 7A

1.1.1.1.1.1.2  Clause 7B

*1.1.1.1.1.2  Clause 6B*

*1.1.1.1.2  Clause 5B*
