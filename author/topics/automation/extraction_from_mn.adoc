== Extracting content from Metanorma

=== General

Images, source code, and requirements can all be extracted out of the
generated Metanorma XML downstream, by the `metanorma -e` command.

=== Specifying filenames

By default, the filename for each extracted snippet is automatically
generated. (Extraction only applies to data-uri encoded images,
which no longer preserve their filename.)

The attribute `filename` on images, source code, and requirements
gives the filename that any inline-encoded
images, source code, and requirements should be
exported to, if that is requested by downstream tools.

--
[filename="image1.gif"]
image::logo.gif
--

In this instance, the image is read in from `logo.gif`, but is converted in the
XML output to a data-uri encoding. The encoding will have the filename attribute
of `image1.gif`; that instructs any downstream processing that extracts images
out of the file (such as `metanorma -e`) to extract this image to the file `image1.gif`,
instead of using an automatically generated filename.
