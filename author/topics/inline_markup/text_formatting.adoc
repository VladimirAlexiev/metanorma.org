Metanorma supports extensive inline formatting functionality.
The following formatting macros are available in Metanorma.

== Basic markup

AsciiDoc allows you to:

* Emphasize words in *bold* using asterisks
* _Italicise_ words with underscores
* Apply `monospace` format using backticks
* Specify superscript and subscript characters (CO~2~, x^4^)

.Example of basic inline markup
====
[source,adoc]
----
*bold*
_italic_
`monospace`
^superscript^
~subscript~
----

Renders as:

*bold*
_italic_
`monospace`
^superscript^
~subscript~

=== Strikethrough

The `strike` command renders text with a middle line strikethrough.

The syntax is as follows:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[strike]#text#
----

Where:

* `text` is the text to be rendered with the strikethrough style

[example]
.Illustration of strikethrough text in Metanorma.
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
[strike]#strike through text#
----

renders:

====


=== Small caps

The `smallcap` command renders text in small capital letters.

The syntax is as follows:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[smallcap]#text#
----

Where:

* `text` is the text to be rendered in small caps

[example]
.Illustration of small caps text
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
[smallcap]#small caps text#
----

renders:

====

=== Underline

The underline command renders text with an underline. [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.7.2].

The syntax is as follows:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[underline]#text#
----

Where:

* `text` is the text to be underlined

[example]
.Illustration of underlined text
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
[underline]#underline text#
----

renders:

image::/assets/author/topics/document-format/text/fig-underline.png[Illustration of underlined text in Metanorma]

=== Numeric ranges

Numeric ranges, like dates (e.g., _1981&ndash;1995_), make use of
_en dashes_ in between the numbers, usually without any white space around.

At the time writing, there is no AsciiDoc encoding to render en dashes.

In Metanorma, there is a vision of implementing a semantic encoding for
numeric ranges, perhaps an option like `range:[n,m]` or shorthands like `n..m`.

For the time being, the existent workaround for such cases is
the use of entity codes, more specifically:

[source,adoc]
----
&&#x200c;ndash;
----

=== Character substitutions

tag::char-subs[]

Metanorma AsciiDoc supports
https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/subs/replacements/[Asciidoctor-style character substitutions]
as shown in <<table-char-sub>>.

Metanorma AsciiDoc also recognises HTML and XML character references,
and decimal and hexadecimal Unicode code points.

[[table-char-sub]]
.Supported Metanorma AsciiDoc character substitutions
[cols="a,2a,a"]
|===
|Source  |Rendered as | Note

|pass:[(C)]  | (C) (Unicode 'Copyright Sign' `U+00A9`)|
|pass:[(R)]  | (R) (Unicode 'Registered Sign' `U+00AE`)|
|pass:[(TM)] | (TM) (Unicode 'Trade Mark Sign' `U+2122`)|
|`-`  | &#8212; (Unicode 'Em Dash' `U+2014`) | See NOTE below.
|pass:[...]  | ... (Unicode 'Horizontal Ellipsis' `U+2026`)|
|pass:[->]   | -> (Unicode 'Rightwards Arrow' `U+2192`)|
|pass:[=>]   | => (Unicode 'Rightwards Double Arrow' `U+21D2`)|
|pass:[<-]   | <- (Unicode 'Leftwards Arrow' `U+2190`)|
|pass:[<=]   | <= (Unicode 'Leftwards Double Arrow' `U+21D0`)|
|`'`    | Smart single quote, smart apostrophe |
|`"`    | Smart double quote |

|===

NOTE: Replacement of `-` only occurs when placed between two word
characters, between a word character and a line boundary, or flanked
by spaces. Flanking spaces (as in `x -- y`) are rendered as thin
spaces (Unicode 'Thin Space' `U+2009`).

// `--` is rendered as an en-dash (&#8211;), which is not catered for by escapes.

=== CSS declarations

The `css` command is used to wrap content with a CSS declaration
(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSS_Object_Model/CSS_Declaration[MDN])
[added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.1.6].

This feature only applies to HTML output.

NOTE: CSS declarations are also used within the HTML `style` attribute.

The syntax is as follows:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[css {css-directive}]#{styled-text}#
--

Where:

* `{css-directive}` is a CSS declaration

* `{styled-text}` is text where the CSS declaration is to be applied

[example]
.Example of applying a custom CSS declaration to content
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
[css font-family:"Noto Sans JP"]#お好み焼き#

[css font-family:"Noto Sans Canadian Aboriginal"]#ᓀᐦᐃᔭᐍᐏᐣ#
--
====


=== Identifier

The `identifier` command, used to indicate that its contents are an identifier
as semantic markup (and not to be processed as a
hyperlink) [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.1.2].

The syntax is as follows:

[source,asciidoc]
----
identifier:[my-identifier]
----

Where:

* `my-identifier` is the identifier to be encoded.


This functionality is very useful for encoding URIs, which can be virtually
indistinguishable from URLs that can be resolved. URIs very often cannot
be resolved since they are simply namespaced identifiers.

[example]
.Example of rendering a URI using the `identifier` command
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
identifier:[https://schemas.isotc211.org/19115/-1/mdb/1.3]
--

renders:

____
`https&#x200c;://schemas.isotc211.org/19115/-1/mdb/1.3`
____
====

[example]
.Example of rendering a URN using the `identifier` command
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
identifier:[urn:iso:std:iso:8601:-1:en]
----

renders:

____
`urn:iso:std:iso:8601:-1:en`
____
====


=== Semantic spans

The `span` command is used to introduce semantic markup into
Metanorma text [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.1.6].

The syntax is as follows:

[source,asciidoc]
----
span:category[text]
----

Where:

* `category` is a semantic label for the content given as `text`
* `text` is the textual content

Here, the _text_ is tagged as belonging to _category_.

A semantically-tagged text with `span` is not normally rendered any different to
normal, although the semantic markup introduced can be used to influence
rendering.

NOTE: Only certain Metanorma flavors support enhanced rendering for
semantically-tagged content.


=== Nesting of styles

Character styles can be nested within each other, with both constrained and
unconstrained formatting marks.
