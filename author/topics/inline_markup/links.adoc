title: Adding links and cross-references
---
tag::tutorial[]
References are an integral part of standards. The main mechanism for references are anchors and destinations. There are four types of references:

* Hyperlinks to an external source, for example a link to a website
* Metadata references
* Internal references to a section, image, table, etc.
* link:author/topics/sections/entering_bib.adoc[Bibliographic entries]

== Hyperlinks

AsciiDoc lets you include links to external sources, and sources to files within the same project.

To reference an *internal* source:

. Use the https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/link-macro/[link macro] to include a link to a file. The syntax looks like this: `\link:PATH[]`.
. Add link text in square brackets after the path.
+

*Updating file extension automatically*

Links to other Metanorma documents are expected to change their suffix depending on whether they are rendered as HTML, PDF, or DOC. 

To update file extensions automatically, add `updatetype=true` into the square brackets. 
The link path must be https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_filepaths.asp[relative] and can not contain a file suffix.

.Example of how to use the `updatetype` option
[source,asciidoc]
--
link:../parent[updatetype=true]
link:../child[This Is The Child Document,updatetype=true]
--

This will link to `../parent.html` and `../child.html` in HTML, and to
 `../parent.pdf` and `../child.pdf` in PDF.

To reference an *external* source:

. Paste the URL into the document.
. Add link text in square brackets after the URL (optional) `URL[Link text]`. 
+

*Adding acessibility in URIs* 

To add acessibility URIs, use the `,title=...` option in the square brackets. 
The option corresponds to HTML's alt text `a@title` attribute.

== Metadata references

Every document contains a set of metadata to describe the document. You can insert a metadata reference by putting the attribute in curly braces `{attribute}`. The reference will be replaced with the value in the rendered output.

:subcommittee-number: 11
:subcommittee: Fasteners with metric external thread

This document was prepared by Technical Committee ISO/TC {technical-committee-number}, _{technical-committee}_, Subcommittee SC {subcommittee-number}, _{subcommittee}_.
----

== Internal references

To link to an important section, table, figure, formula, or list item in your document:

. Set an anchor using double square brackets before the content you want to reference: `\[[anchor]]`. 
+

.Typical gelatinization curve 
image::images/rice_image2.png[Image of the gelatinization curve] 
----
+
.Rendered image caption
image::../assets/author/tutorials/references_img_anchor.jpg[]

. To reference an anchor, type the anchor name like this `\<<anchor>>`.
+

. To set an alternative text other than the anchor text, append the text inside the brackets using a comma.

// Include in Auto Numbering topic??
=== Auto-numbering of references
Metanorma automatically numbers and names references; because they are autonumbered, they will be renumbered automatically if you insert any new text of the same type. 

Since the markup will be converted into XML, the anchor must follow the https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-names11/[XML namespace conventions]. Therefore, an anchor name name must not contain:

* colons
* whitespaces
* words starting with numbers
