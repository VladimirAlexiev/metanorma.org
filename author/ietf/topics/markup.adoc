== Abstract

Any paragraphs following the document header are treated as the abstract
(`front/abstract`), whether or not they are in abstract style. The abstract is
terminated by either the first section header (which ends the document
preamble), or an admonition (e.g. `note`).

Any admonitions before the first section header are treated as notes (`front/note`).

== Source code listings

In RFC XML, `sourcecode` (v3) and `artwork` (v2) elements only occur within a
`figure` wrapper; Metanorma-IETF supplies that wrapper if it is not provided
explicitly.

== ASCII Art and Images

In RFC XML, `artwork` elements only occur within a
`figure` wrapper; Metanorma-IETF supplies that wrapper if it is not provided
explicitly.

== Mathematical examples

Mathematical examples are treated identically to literals, and are rendered as `artwork` in both v2 and v3;
however their default alignment is set as `center`. As with inline stem expressions, they are treated identically
to monospace expressions in the RFC XML output; they are not currently rendered as MathML or any other notation.

== Lists

RFC XML v2 does not support multiparagraph list items. Following the specification recommendation,
paragraphs within v2 list items are replaced with `vspace` tages.

== Sidebar (RFC v3 only)

== Tables

The converter respects the AsciiDoc (horizontal) align attributes of cells (v2,
v3), column widths (v2), and `colspan`, `rowspan` attributes (v3).

(Exceptionally,
column widths specified for v2 as `"1,1,1,1,1,1...."` will be ignored, since Asciidoctor
internally treats them identically to unspecified column widths on a table.)

--
<1> v3: `table@anchor`; v2: `texttable@anchor`
<2> v2: `texttable@suppress-title`, `texttable@align`, `texttable@style` (attributes only available in v2). Mapping of Asciidoc grid attribute to RFC XML style attribute is: `all` > `all`, `cols` > `full`, `none` > `none`, `rows` > `headers` (although the two are not strictly equivalent).
<3> v3: `table/name`; v2: `texttable@title`
<4> v3: `table/thead/tr/td`; v2: `texttable/ttcol@id` (attribute only available in v2), `texttable/ttcol`

<6> v3: `table/tbody/tr/td@anchor` (attribute only available in v3)
<7> v3: `table/tfoot/tr/td`; v2: `texttable/c`

NOTE: v3 permits table cells to contain block elements, such as paragraphs and lists. (This is done in Asciidoc by prefixing
the table cell with `a|`.) However v2 only permits inline tagging, and any block tags are ignored.
