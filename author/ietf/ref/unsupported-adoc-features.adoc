|===

The document model of Metanorma AsciiDoc and RFC XML are different. In particular,

* Metanorma AsciiDoc and RFC XML differ in where they allow anchors to be placed:
Metanorma AsciiDoc does not allow anchors within tables and lists, and RFC XML v3 does
not permit anchors for the `note` or `abstract` elements, while RFC XML v2
uses anchors for much fewer block elements (e.g. `artwork`, `list`.)
* Metanorma AsciiDoc has a more restrictive block model: it regards elements such as
admonitions, lists, and tables as blocks, and does not allow them to be nested
within paragraphs.

As a result, it may be necessary to post-edit the RFC XML output if the block
model produced does not reflect the intended structure accurately.
