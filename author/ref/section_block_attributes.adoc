= Section Attributes

== Language & script

The language and script of a section is indicated via the optional attributes
`language` and `script`:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[language=fr]
== Section 3

[appendix,script=Zmth]
== Math Appendix
--

== Obligations

The obligation of a section—whether it is normative or informative—is indicated
via the attribute “obligation” (see example below).

For most sections, this is fixed; for annexes and clauses,
the default value of the obligation is "normative" and users need to set the obligation
to "informative" as a section attribute if needed. For example:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[[AnnexA]]
[appendix,obligation=informative]
== Determination of defects
--

== Numbering

As with link:/author/topics/document-format/text#numbering-override[block element numbering],
a clause number may be provided to override auto-numbering.

For instance, in order to number out-of-sequence clauses in updated
documents or amendments [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.7.3].

A manual clause number is specified with the attribute `number`:

[source,asciidoc]
----
== Clause 7

[number=0]
=== Zeroth Subclause
----

Elements subsequent to the manually numbered element will be auto-numbered
so as to follow the previous element. This may include incrementing the final
letter in an alphanumeric clause number (e.g. _7a_ followed by _7b_.)

If resumption of auto-numbering is not intended for subsequent clauses
(e.g. _7bis_ should not be followed by _7bit_),
an explicit number also needs to be given to those clauses separately.

== Inline headings

Inline subclause headings (e.g. for test methods) are indicated by preceding the heading
with the `[%inline-header]` option attribute. So in the Rice Model document,

[source,asciidoc]
--
[%inline-header]
==== Sieve,

with round perforations of diameter 1,4 mm.
--

renders as

____
*A.2.1.1. Sieve,* with round perforations of diameter 1,4 mm.
____

// Dump 2 from existing docs

== Paragraph alignment

Paragraph alignment is defined as an attribute for paragraphs:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[align=left]
This paragraph is aligned left

[align=center]
This paragraph is aligned center

[align=right]
This paragraph is aligned right

[align=justified]
This paragraph is justified, which is the default
--

which renders

If you have line-breaks in a paragraph, and the default alignment in the stylesheet
is justified (as is often the case in Word output), you will need to set `[align=left]`
to make the paragraph look as normally expected:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[align=left]
Vache Equipment +
Fictitious +
World +
mailto:gehf@vacheequipment.fic[]
--

which renders

.Illustration of left-alignment for multiple line-breaks in Metanorma.

== Page breaks

Page breaks can be given a page orientation, which applies from that
point forward until the next page break with a page
orientation [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.3.17].

Page orientation only appears in paged output, such as in Word.

To set content to landscape mode, the syntax is:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[%landscape]
<<<
--

To set content to portrait mode, the syntax is:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[%portrait]
<<<
--

If no orientation option is given, the text after the page break
remains in the same orientation as that before. In Word, page breaks
changing orientation are realised as distinct sections.

In Metanorma, documents are split into three sections by default:

* a cover page,
* a preface, and
* the main document body (including annexes and bibliography)
* (some documents also have a colophon)

The page orientation is reset at the start of the main document body to `portrait`.


EXAMPLE:

[source,asciidoc]
--
// Content following this directive will be shown in landscape mode
[%landscape]
<<<

...

// Content following this directive will return to portrait mode
[%portrait]
<<<

...

--

=== Avoiding page breaks

The "`keep with next`" feature is useful if you want to indicate that
a document element must belong on the same page with another element.
Kind of like the opposite of a "`page break`".

Most blocks support the boolean attributes `keep-with-next` and
`keep-lines-together` [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.4.1].

The following syntax indicates that these two paragraphs will always be
presented on the same page, even if the textual layout allows them to be
split into two pages.

[source,asciidoc]
--
[keep-with-next=true]
This is a paragraph.

This is a paragraph that will be on the same page as the
immediately previous one.
