== Output formats

* (Optional) An HTML preview generated directly from an AsciiDoc document,
using native AsciiDoc formatting.
** http://asciimath.org[AsciiMathML] is to be used for mathematical formatting.
Metanorma-M3D uses the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciimath[Ruby AsciiMath parser],
which is syntactically stricter than the common MathJax processor;
if you do not get expected results, try bracketing terms your in AsciiMathML
expressions.
* an XML representation of the document, intended as a document model for M3D
International Standards.
* The XML representation is processed in turn to generate the following outputs
as end deliverable M3D standard drafts.
** HTML
** Microsoft Word DOC

== Markup
