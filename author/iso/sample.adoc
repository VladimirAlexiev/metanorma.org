== Building the sample

To build the document via the provided Makefile, simply run `make` from within
the sample directory.

[NOTE]
====
By default, `make` expects that  `metanorma` binary is available somewhere on your path.

If you are using Docker-based distribution of Metanorma,
run `export METANORMA_DOCKER=1`, then `make` will invoke Metanorma through Docker container.

- See link:/author/getting-started/#install-metanorma[Getting started]
  for the different ways of getting the Metanorma toolchain set up.
