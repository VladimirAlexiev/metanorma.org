= Syntax for writing OGC documents using Metanorma

== Document attributes

[[note_general_doc_ref_doc_attrib_ogc]]
[NOTE]
====
Document attributes listed below are unique to the processing of OGC documents in Metanorma.

For _common document attributes_, see link:/author/ref/document-attributes/[Document attributes reference] in general Metanorma authorâ€™s documentation. That page describes attributes that apply to all Metanorma flavors, not just OGC.

For an _introduction to AsciiDoc document attributes_ and how Metanorma uses them, see link:/author/topics/document-format/meta-attributes/[the corresponding topic].

=== Mapping to OGC legacy AsciiDoc

Metanorma-OGC permits legacy OGC AsciiDoc template attributes,
and are treated as synonyms of the corresponding Metanorma attributes:

|===
| OGC Metanorma AsciiDoc                    | OGC legacy AsciiDoc

| `:copyright-year:`                        | `:copyrightYear`
| `:workgroup:`                             | `:workingGroup:`
| `:published-date:`                        | `:publicationDate:`
| `:issued-date:`                           | `:approvalDate:`
| `:received-date:`                         | `:submissionDate:`
| `:docnumber:`                             | `docReference`
| `:fullname:`, with `:role:` = `editor`    | `editor`

== Markup

=== Sections

The Normative References section may be named just "`References`", reflecting OGC practice.

=== Preliminary elements

The following clauses are preliminary elements, and are moved into the frontispiece
of the document (in Metanorma, the document preface):

* Abstract
* Keywords
* Preface
* Submitting Organizations
* Submitters

The abstract is recognized as the first clause with an `abstract` style attribute:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[abstract]
== Abstract

My abstract...
----

The preface is recognized as the text between the AsciiDoc document attributes and
the first AsciiDoc section title; it must not be given a section title of its own.

[source,asciidoc]
----
:received-date: 2019-01-01

.Preface

preface text

=== Submitters
----

"`Keywords`" and "`Submitting Organizations`" consist of lists.
They are treated as document metadata,
and are entered as a document attribute.
The prefatory text introducing them is added automatically.

"`Submitters`" are treated as a table, contained in a section with the title `Submitters`:

[source,asciidoc]
----
=== Submitters

|===
|Name |Representing |OGC member

|Steve Liang | University of Calgary, Canada / SensorUp Inc. | Yes
|===
----

=== Examples

Unlike the normal case in Metanorma, examples can have captions:

=== Recommendations, requirements, and permissions

NOTE: This subsection supplements link:/author/topics/document-format/requirements-recommendations-permissions[Requirement, Recommendation, and Permission blocks] in general Metanorma documentation.

For legacy reasons, a second Metanorma AsciiDoc syntax is permitted for
recommendations, requirements and permissions.

These may also be recognized in Metanorma
AsciiDoc as tables whose first cell contains the text _Recommendation_, _Requirement_, _Permission_,
optionally followed by a number (which is ignored in parsing; the elements are renumbered
automatically in rendering.) These are currently constituted of two elements: an internal
label, which is parsed as the first paragraph of the second table cell, and the body of
the recommendation etc., which is parsed as the remainder of the second table cell.

[source,asciidoc]
----
[[recommendation1]]
|===
|Recommendation |/ogc/recommendation/wfs/2 +

If the API definition document uses the OpenAPI Specification 3.0,
the document SHOULD conform to the
<<rc_oas30,OpenAPI Specification 3.0 requirements class>>.
