Metanorma-GB is a document processor & standard for creating
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guobiao_standards[Chinese Standards].

It can also be used to generate Chinese local or sector standards, which
have the same format; it formats the title page to have the correct
metadata displayed.

Standards are generated from AsciiDoc-based markup in a way that is
compliant with GB/T 1.1.

[NOTE]
====
Across Metanorma-GB documentation, "GB standard" should be read as referring
to any Chinese national, sector or local standard.
