---

The Metanorma project kicks off its
https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs[Google's Season of Docs] 2021!

We have received a large number of applications for the technical writer
position the last few weeks. Thank you to all who have applied.

Given the excellent applicants this season, our team eventually
recruited not just one, but two, experienced technical writers
that are passionate about what we do. The additional funding needed
for the second writer was matched by the Metanorma project itself.

Please note that the selection process involves alignment to strategic
needs of the Metanorma project, and not having been selected to this
cohort does not indicate any inference of ability of the applying writers.

We welcome the new writers to our team:

* https://www.linkedin.com/in/writer-tripathi/[Ankita Tripathi],
  a highly experienced technical writer fluent in open source,
  community management, and developer relations.
  Ankita holds a B.Tech. in Information Technology from the
  Global Institute of Technology, Jaipur,
  and is based in Bangalore.
  She is also a Project Steering Committee
  member of https://thegooddocsproject.dev[The Good Docs Project].

* https://www.linkedin.com/in/tina-luedtke[Tina Lüdtke],
  an impressive technical writer experienced
  in ontology and semantic technologies. Tina holds a
  B.Eng. in Technical Writing and Communication from the
  ​University of Applied Sciences, Munich, and is based in London.

Interestingly, both Ankita and Tina have spoken at the popular
http://www.writethedocs.org[Write the Docs] conferences.

I am sure Ankita and Tina will keep all of us updated on their
quest for better documentation.

Congratulations again to our new colleagues, and a heartfelt thank you
to all who have attended to the process!
